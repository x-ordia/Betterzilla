* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Components </span>- The components directory contains all of the components used in the frontend.These components are modular, self-contained units that encapsulate specific functionality or UI elements. Organizing components into a dedicated directory helps maintain a clean and structured project architecture, making it easier to locate, reuse, and manage individual components across different parts of the application
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pages </span>- The pages directory contains all of the pagesused in the frontend.These pages are composed of the components directory.Organizing pagesinto a dedicated directory helps maintain a clean and structured project architecture, too.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Assets </span>- the assets directory houses static files such as images, icons, and other media resources used in the application's UI. These files are often referenced by components to enhance the visual presentation and user experience. Organizing assets into a dedicated directory helps maintain a clear separation between code and static resources, making it easier to manage and update them.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Redux </span>- The "redux" directory typically contains files related to state management using the Redux library in a React application. This directory serves as a central hub for Redux-related logic, including actions, reducers, selectors, and middleware. By organizing Redux-related files into a dedicated folder, developers can maintain a clear separation of concerns and facilitate easier navigation and understanding of the application's state management architecture.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Main.jsx -</span>  The "main.jsx" file serves as the entry point or main file for the application's React components. It often acts as the central hub where various components are imported, initialized, and rendered within the application's DOM structure. The "main.jsx" file is crucial for bootstrapping the React application and orchestrating the overall user interface.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">App.jsx -</span>  The "App.jsx" file is a central component that typically serves as the main container for the application's user interface. It encapsulates the structure of the entire application and orchestrates the rendering of various components within it.

Additionally, its distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling and high availability.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Documentation </span>- 



* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">server/db </span>- The code defines constants for different types of data in a chat application. It establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the MongoClient module, storing the database object for later use. The connectDB function asynchronously connects to the database using the provided URL. If successful, it assigns the database object to the 'db' variable; otherwise, it passes any errors to the 'done' callback function.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">server/helper/chat.js</span>  - The provided module offers functions to interact with MongoDB for managing chat data. Functions include adding new responses, updating existing chats, retrieving chat history, and managing file attachments. These operations are performed based on user and chat identifiers, ensuring efficient chat management within the application.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">server/helper/user.js</span> - This module provides functions for user authentication and profile management. It includes sign-up, login, password reset, and profile update functionalities. User data is stored in MongoDB collections, with password encryption using bcrypt. It utilizes temporary collections for pending sign-ups and password reset requests, ensuring secure and efficient user management. Additionally, it integrates with AWS S3 for profile picture uploads. These features collectively offer a robust and secure user authentication and profile management system for applications.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">server/mail</span> - This module utilizes Nodemailer to send emails through Gmail's SMTP server. It retrieves email credentials and configuration from environment variables using dotenv. The createTransport function sets up the email service with Gmail, and sendMail sends an email with specified recipients, subject, and HTML content. Error handling logs any encountered errors, while successful email delivery logs confirmation. This setup enables sending emails for various purposes within applications, such as notifications, verifications, or communication features.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">server/routes/chat.js</span> - This Express router handles various API endpoints for interacting with a chat system. It incorporates authentication middleware to verify user identity via JWT tokens. The routes support functionalities like sending and receiving messages, retrieving chat history, managing attachments, and deleting chat records. It utilizes OpenAI's API for natural language processing tasks and MongoDB for data storage. Error handling ensures proper responses for various scenarios, such as missing data or internal server errors. Overall, the router provides a robust backend for real-time chat applications with advanced features like AI assistance and file attachments.
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">server/routes/user.js</span> - This JavaScript file contains an Express.js router for handling various authentication and user-related functionalities. It includes routes for signing up, logging in, updating profiles, handling forgotten passwords, sending OTPs (one-time passwords), and more. The code uses MongoDB for database operations and nodemailer for sending emails. It also utilises JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization. The file follows a modular structure and incorporates error handling for various scenarios. Overall, it provides a robust backend infrastructure for managing user accounts and authentication processes in a web application.
